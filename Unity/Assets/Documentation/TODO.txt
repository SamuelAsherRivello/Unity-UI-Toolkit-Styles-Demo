TODO
* Make a typical localization setup? Perhaps it's out of scope. I have another demo repo for that.
* Make a standard custom component? Perhaps it's out of scope. I have another demo repo for that.
* Make a custom component THAT ACCEPTS CHILDREN. This is not the default behavior of Unity, but MIGHT be possible and would help to demonstrate high compatibility between two similar pages. I'll think about it.

WORKFLOW: PROS
* Global styles (e.g. all layouts)
* Shared styles (e.g. all page layouts)
* Unshared styles (e.g. layout specific)
* Excellent cascading of styles. 
* Excellent theming (dark is default at **BOTH** edit-time and runtime)
* Excellent use of UI Builder (100% proper preview of all layout, styles, variables... except "pending")

WORKFLOW: CONS
* (None)

WORKFLOW: PENDING
* How to auto-complete when entering custom variables in ui builder? Given my particular file setup, I'm not seeing it.
